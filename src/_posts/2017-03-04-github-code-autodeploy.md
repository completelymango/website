I haven't made many updates to this site lately, partly because my website setup was a little complicated. I'm now hosting my site on an Amazon ec2 instance; github pages is great, but I want to be able to write web applications and process multiplayer game logic, which requires access to a backend server. Previously I needed to SSH into the box and manually git-pull in the local repository. It wasn't difficult, but it did add friction to the process, so I decided to fix that today.

I forked and updated a public gist with my experiences. I'll link that here instead of retyping it all out:
