<p>This is a project that several of my college friends and I worked on in 2016. Check it out!: <a href="http://beer.107w.io">beer.107w.io</a></p>

<p>The idea is that you, as a bar owner, can enter in all of the different beer types that you have on your taplist. Then customers can enter in a list of beers that they like (from any beer in the world) and the system will recommend a beer to them from the taplist.</p>
