<p><span class="image left"><img src="/images/traxxasBeginning.jpg" alt="" /></span>My parents got me a remote controlled car when I was a kid. Traxxas Stampede, I forget the original model number but it was a really nice car. The range on the remote control must have been over 100 meters - we were able to race it from our house all the way down to the end of the cul-de-sac. I could run pretty fast, but the top speed of the car was way faster than I could keep up with (at the time). And the shocks, the first time I have ever seen shocks on a toy car, made it feel like a real car (to my 7 year old self). </p>

<p> So it was a real bummer when I hit a jump sideways, the body twisting and separating in mid-air. Admittedly the crash looked pretty cool, but my 7-year-old self had no chance at fixing it.</p>

<p>The next Christmas they got my brother and I new ones. I have one of them here still with me, and I'm going to try to hook it up to a raspberry pi.</p>
