I was lucky enough to attend [Steam Dev Days] in 2014: a developer conference that Valve Software set up here in Seattle. It was set up as a forum for game developers to come together and ask questions face to face with Valve employees, and learn about a lot of different topics in game development: VR, OpenGL, marketing your game, Linux Dev, and Steam Machines to name a few. My favorite thing was learning about Valve's [OpenGL debugging tool]. They showed multiple opengl trace playbacks on screen at the same time. I know the computer it was running on must have been hurting -- especially since they said they previously burned out an Nvidia 680 while testing. Being able to pause an OpenGL stream, edit shaders and continue playback sounds amazing, and I imagine it would be an incredibly useful tool for developers.

Steam Controller
----------------

Everyone in attendance received an early prototype of the steam controller. It has buttons in the center, but none where my thumbs rest; instead, there are two circular touch pads. Some games I played (like Towerfall Ascention) used the right touchpad directions as buttons: left right up down == X B Y A from an xbox controller, for example. Other games (like Portal 2) used them both like joysticks on an xbox controller: one for moving your face and one for moving your feets. I believe this is entirely customizable.

I play a lot of fast-paced games like TF2 and L4D2. Those games definitely felt strange initially; trying to play them on a touchpad (on my laptop) always ends badly, so I had some concerns going into it. I can aim accurately or I can aim quickly, and in the chaos of L4d2 matches it's easy to miss zombies and accidentally hit teammates. 

In practice though, I feel like there is lots of potential here. The ribs on the touch pads are a nice feature -- they help me feel how far away from center my thumbs are resting (which determines how fast you move in some games). The controller makes a small clicking sound and vibrates on touch. The haptic feedback is a nice touch; I believe that over time it will make the controller feel more natural to use. But with all of that said, I'm still happy that Valve is adding an analog joystick and normal face buttons to the [final version].

Steam Box
---------

Everyone in attendance also received a well-specced [steam machine]. I got the impression that even [Gabe was surprised]. I've played several games on it, and I've learned that playing games on my TV is a ton of fun. My TV is newer and nicer than my monitor (which may have something to do with it), but it's more comfortable to sit back on my couch with a controller. I can hop in and out of a game easily in Big Picture mode, and my Steam Machine wins hands down when it comes to local co-op games. I had a ton of fun playing through Towerfall Ascention with a friend.

In-home streaming worked really well for me. I have hard wire connections for everything, but I noticed no lag when playing Dragon Age: Inquisition (which isn't even a steam game) from my windows box. I hope they open this up for streaming to external networks, and possibly streaming to mobile devices? I'd love to play a game like XCom on my android tablet while riding the bus to work.

I did notice a *very* small amount of graphics detail loss when streaming 1080p games to my steam machine. Also I sometimes had problems launching non-steam games: Dragon-age failed to open a couple times on my windows box, causing my steam machine to display a black screen. My biggest problem right now is it's lack of media center functionality. I bet it wouldn't take very much effort to add Netflix or Hulu applications to the Steam store (though getting them to play nice with a Steam Controller may be a challenge). The dream for me would be if Steam had applications like Spotify for music, Youtube for videos, and was able to play local media or in-home stream to other devices a la Plex. Maybe some day. These are very small details though, and overall I'm very happy with my setup.
