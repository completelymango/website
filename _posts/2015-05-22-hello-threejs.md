I have gone through many beginners graphics tutorials in my free time: c++ with SDL, Java 3D, and most recently [GoLang]. The tutorials usually start out with drawing a triangle on the screen, and slowly progressing to 3D objects and animations.

BOOM - three birds with one stone. I modeled that but couldn't figure out how to get [textures] into threejs. It's a start.

This was just a proof of concept. I plan on working through more [threejs examples] in the near future, and I'll add posts here as I complete them.
